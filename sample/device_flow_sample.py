The configuration file would look like this:

{
    "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common",
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "scope": ["User.ReadBasic.All"],
        // You can find the other permission names from this document
        // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference

        // You can find more Microsoft Graph API endpoints from Graph Explorer
