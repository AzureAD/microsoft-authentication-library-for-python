How to perform Threat Model review
==================================

Note to MSAL Python team.

1. Update the self-attestation here:
   https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/ID-InfraSec-ThreatModels?path=%2Fsrc%2FThreatModels%2FAuth%20Client%2FMSAL%20Python&version=GBmaster&_a=contents

   (You can NOT use the "Edit" button in the top right corner of the binary file.
   You must clone the repo locally, and use git to update the file.)

2. Create a PR for it.

3. Create a placeholder review meeting at https://threatmodelingportal.azurewebsites.net/
