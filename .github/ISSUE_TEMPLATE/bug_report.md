**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to our [off-the-shelf samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/tree/dev/sample) and pick one that is closest to your usage scenario. You should not need to modify the sample.
2. Follow the description of the sample, typically at the beginning of it, to prepare a `config.json` containing your test configurations
3. Run such sample, typically by `python sample.py config.json`
4. See the error
5. In this bug report, tell us the sample you choose, paste the content of the config.json with your test setup (which you can choose to skip your credentials, and/or mail it to our developer's email).
